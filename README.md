# weatherpy

## This code repository was designed to show us how to map, configure and pull data with API's.

- Learned how to configure api's for use in python. 
- Learned how to view and read JSON data.
- Learned how to request data out of JSON and integrate into a PD DataFrame.
- Configuration and marking of gmap data with our data for interactive mapping.
- Learned how to create and import API keys in a config file so that we can interact with our API's without exposing our key.

The overall summation of this module was to learn the basics of finding api's, reading results and structures within the specific api and then how to use said
data within our lists and dataframes to out put useful maps such as weather, directions, and places of interest. This also gives the basic structure on how we would interact with any API within python and how to use the API owners directions for interacting with said API.
